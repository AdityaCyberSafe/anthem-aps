Aweigh is a non-satellite based navigation alternative, inspired by the polarised vision of insects and ancient celestial navigation. 
This repository contains all the files necessary for building a device. It is currently subject to modifications.

The team is working on increasing the resolution of the device and developing a better distribution platform. 
Most of the files included here are still under construction. Aweigh users are invited to contribute and share their ideas, hacks, and 
improvements in this repository.
